# HTML-CSS-PROJECTS 
This repository contains a collection of mini projects built using HTML and CSS.
Each project is designed to practice and strengthen core web development skills â€” from basic page structures to more advanced layouts and designs.

###  New projects will be added regularly as I continue learning and exploring web development.
